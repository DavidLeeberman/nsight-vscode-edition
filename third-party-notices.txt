"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

License: EPL-2.0
License text:

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
    PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
     Distributed under this Agreement, and

  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
     i) changes to the Program, and
     ii) additions to the Program;
  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
  "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
  are not Modified Works.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
or Modified Works thereof.

"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
documentation source, and configuration files.

"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
Contributor.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.

  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
  licensed hereunder.

  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
  before distributing the Program.

  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).

3. REQUIREMENTS

3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
  used for software exchange; and

  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
     for a particular purpose;

     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and

     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
     of this section 3.

3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
  the Program.

3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
their own appropriate notices.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice

"This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
  look for such a notice.

  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# haz

<a href="http://apostrophenow.org/"><img src="https://raw.github.com/punkave/haz/master/logos/logo-box-madefor.png" align="right" /></a>

Determines if a program exists in the PATH environment variable. Cross platform, including support for checking likely executable file extensions on Windows. Available in synchronous and asynchronous versions. Thorough unit tests included.

## Installation

    npm install haz

## Usage

Here's a synchronous example:

```javascript
var haz = require('haz');

if (haz('convert')) {
  // Great, use spawn to run imagemagick's convert
}
```

And here's an asynchronous example with a callback:

```javascript
var haz = require('haz');

haz('convert', function(result) {
  if (result) {
    // Great, use spawn to run imagemagick's convert
  }
});
```

If you don't pass a callback, it behaves synchronously. Simple, right?

## Tests

    npm test

The tests convince  `haz` that is running in a realistic Windows environment for the Windows tests, and do the same for the Linux/Unix/MacOS/whatever tests.

## About P'unk Avenue and Apostrophe

`haz` was created at [P'unk Avenue](http://punkave.com) for use in many projects built with Apostrophe, an open-source content management system built on node.js. (You don't need Apostrophe to use `haz`.) If you like `haz` you should definitely [check out apostrophenow.org](http://apostrophenow.org). Also be sure to visit us on [github](http://github.com/punkave).

## Support

Feel free to open issues on [github](http://github.com/punkave/haz).

universal-analytics
=======

A node module for Google's [Universal Analytics](http://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&hlrm=de&answer=2790010) tracking via the [Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/).

This module allows tracking data (or rather, users) from within a Node.js application. Tracking is initiated on the server side and, if required, does not require any more tracking in the browser.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/universal-analytics.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/universal-analytics) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peaksandpies/universal-analytics.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peaksandpies/universal-analytics)

# Getting started

`universal-analytics` is installed and included like any other node module:

```
$ npm install universal-analytics
```

```javascript
var ua = require('universal-analytics');

// Or with ES6 import
import ua from 'universal-analytics'
```

Initialization expects at least your Google Analytics account ID:

```javascript
var visitor = ua('UA-XXXX-XX');
```

This will create a `universal-analytics` Visitor instance that you can use and keep around to track a specific client (Not to be confused with the Google Analytics User ID, see [Setting persistent parameters](#setting-persistent-parameters) for more information on that). Since no client ID was specified in the constructor's arguments, a random UUID is generated. In case you have a client ID at hand, you can use that to create the visitor:

```javascript
var visitor = ua('UA-XXXX-XX', '6a14abda-6b12-4578-bf66-43c754eaeda9');
```

Starting with Universal Analytics, a UUID v4 is the preferred client ID format. It is therefor necessary to provide a UUID of such type to `universal-analytics`. However you can force custom client ID, passing `strictCidFormat: false` in the options:

```javascript
var visitor = ua('UA-XXXX-XX', 'CUSTOM_CLIENTID_1', {strictCidFormat: false});
```

If you want to use Google Analytics in http protocol, just include it in the options `http: true`, by default will use https:
```javascript
var visitor = ua('UA-XXXX-XX', {http: true});
```

If you want to set User Id you can add it into options:
```javascript
var visitor = ua('UA-XXXX-XX', {uid: 'as8eknlll'});
```
[see about User Id](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#uid)


Tracking a pageview without much else is now very simple:

```javascript
visitor.pageview("/").send()
```

The first argument for the pageview method is the path of the page to be tracked. Simply calling `pageview()` will not initiate a tracking request. In order to send off tracking to the Google Analytics servers you have two options:

1. You can append a `send()` call after `pageview()`. The tracking request is sent asynchronously. This means you will not receive any confirmation when and if it was successful.
2. You can provide a callback function to `pageview()` as an additional, last argument. This callback will be invoked once the tracking request has finished. Any error that occured during the request will be provided to said callback. In that case `send()` is no longer necessary.

An example of the callback approach:

```javascript
var visitor = ua('UA-XXXX-XX');
visitor.pageview("/", function (err) {
  // Handle the error if necessary.
  // In case no error is provided you can be sure
  // the request was successfully sent off to Google.
});
```



# Tracking


## Pageview tracking

The first argument for the pageview tracking call is the page path. Furthermore, pageview tracking can be improved with the additional parameters to provide the page's hostname and title to Google Analytics. The parameters are provided as arguments after the page path.

```javascript
visitor.pageview("/", "http://peaksandpies.com", "Welcome").send();
```

The following snippet is the exact same tracking using a callback. It is always the last argument.

```javascript
visitor.pageview("/", "http://peaksandpies.com", "Welcome", function (err) {
  // …
});
```

Depending on how you integrate tracking into your app, you might be more comfortable with providing all the tracking data via a params object to the `pageview()` method:

```javascript
visitor.pageview({dp: "/", dt: "Welcome", dh: "http://peaksandpies.com"}).send();
```

This code has the exact same effect as the one above. `dp`, `dt`, and `dh` (as in 'document path', 'document title' and 'document hostname') are the attribute names used by the Measurement Protocol.

It's mandatory to specify either the page path (`dp`) or document location (`dl`). Google Analytics can not track a pageview without a path. To avoid such erroneous requests, `universal-analytics` will deny `pageview()` tracking if the required parameters are omitted.

```javascript
var pagePath = null;

visitor.pageview(pagePath, function (err) {
  // This callback will receive an error
});
```

The following method signatures are available for the `pageview()` method of the Visitor instance:

* `Visitor#pageview(path)`
* `Visitor#pageview(path, callback)`
* `Visitor#pageview(params)`
* `Visitor#pageview(params, callback)`
* `Visitor#pageview(path, hostname)`
* `Visitor#pageview(path, hostname, callback)`
* `Visitor#pageview(path, hostname, title)`
* `Visitor#pageview(path, hostname, title, callback)`

See also: [List of acceptable params](AcceptableParams.md).





## Screenview tracking

Instead of pageviews app will want to track screenviews.

```javascript
visitor.screenview("Home Screen", "App Name").send()
```

The following method signatures are available for #screenview:

* `Visitor#screenview(screenName, appName)`
* `Visitor#screenview(screenName, appName, callback)`
* `Visitor#screenview(screenName, appName, appVersion)`
* `Visitor#screenview(screenName, appName, appVersion, callback)`
* `Visitor#screenview(screenName, appName, appVersion, appId)`
* `Visitor#screenview(screenName, appName, appVersion, appId, callback)`
* `Visitor#screenview(screenName, appName, appVersion, appId, appInstallerId)`
* `Visitor#screenview(screenName, appName, appVersion, appId, appInstallerId, callback)`
* `Visitor#screenview(screenName, appName, appVersion, appId, appInstallerId, params)`
* `Visitor#screenview(screenName, appName, appVersion, appId, appInstallerId, params, callback)`
* `Visitor#screenview(params)`
* `Visitor#screenview(params, callback)`

See also: [List of acceptable params](AcceptableParams.md).






## Event tracking


Tracking events with `universal-analytics` works like pageview tracking, only you have to provide different arguments:

```javascript
visitor.event("Event Category", "Event Action").send()
```

This is the most straightforward way to track an event. The event attributes *label* and *value* are optional and can be provided if necessary:

```javascript
visitor.event("Event Category", "Event Action", "…and a label", 42).send()
```

Just like pageview tracking, event tracking supports a callback as the last argument:

```javascript
visitor.event("Event Category", "Event Action", "…and a label", 42, function (err) {
  // …
})
```

An additional attribute for events is the path of the page they should be associated with in Google Analytics. You can provide this path via an additional params object:

```javascript
visitor.event("Event Category", "Event Action", "…and a label", 42, {p: "/contact"}, function (err) {
  // …
})
```

*Notice:* The page path attribute for the event is called `p` which differs from the `dp` attribute used in the pageview tracking example. `universal-analytics` is smart enough to use the `dp` attribute should you provide it instead of `p`.

In case this argument list is getting a little long, `event()` also accepts a params object like `pageview()`:

```javascript
var params = {
  ec: "Event Category",
  ea: "Event Action",
  el: "…and a label",
  ev: 42,
  dp: "/contact"
}

visitor.event(params).send();
```

The category (`ec`) and the action (`ea`) are mandatory. Google Analytics will not track an event without them. To avoid such erroneous requests, universal-analytics will deny `event()` tracking if either attribute is omitted.

```javascript
var action = null;

visitor.event("Navigation clicks", action, function (err) {
  // This callback will receive an error
});
```

The following method signatures are available for #event:

* `Visitor#event(category, action)`
* `Visitor#event(category, action, callback)`
* `Visitor#event(category, action, label)`
* `Visitor#event(category, action, label, callback)`
* `Visitor#event(category, action, label, value)`
* `Visitor#event(category, action, label, value, callback)`
* `Visitor#event(category, action, label, value, params, callback)`
* `Visitor#event(params)`
* `Visitor#event(params, callback)`

## E-commerce tracking

E-commerce tracking in general is a bit more complex. It requires a combination of one call to the `transaction()` method and one or more calls to the `item()` method.

```javascript
visitor
  .transaction("trans-12345", 500)   // Create transaction trans-12345 worth 500 total.
  .item(300, 1, "item-54321")        // Add 1 unit the item item-54321 worth 300.
  .item(200, 2, "item-41325")        // Add 2 units the item item-41325 worth 200.
  .send()
```

Once again, daisy-chaining simplifies associating the items with the transaction. Officially, nothing but the transaction ID is a requirement for both the transaction and the items. However, providing a minimum set of information (revenue for the transaction, price, quantity and ID for the items) is recommended.

It is also possible to provide the params as an object to both methods:

```javascript
visitor
  .transaction({ti: "trans-12345", tr: 500, ts: 50, tt: 100, ta: "Partner 13"})
  .item({ip: 300, iq: 1, ic: "item-54321", in: "Item 54321", iv: "Blue"})
  .item({ip: 200, iq: 2, ic: "item-41325", in: "Item 41325", iv: "XXL"})
  .send()
```

In case an additional item has to be added later on or daisy-chaining is not available for another reason, each item can be given an associated transaction ID via the params object as well:

visitor.item({ip: 100, iq: 1, ic: "item-41325", in: "Item 41325", iv: "XL", ti: "trans-12345"}).send()

The transaction ID (`ti`) is mandatory for both the transaction and the item. Google Analytics will not track e-commerce data without it. To avoid such erroneous requests, universal-analytics will deny `transaction()` and `item()` tracking if it is omitted.

```javascript
var ti = null;

visitor.transaction(ti, function (err) {
  // This callback will receive an error
});
```

The following method signatures are available for #transaction:

* `Visitor#transaction(id)`
* `Visitor#transaction(id, callback)`
* `Visitor#transaction(id, revenue)`
* `Visitor#transaction(id, revenue, callback)`
* `Visitor#transaction(id, revenue, shipping)`
* `Visitor#transaction(id, revenue, shipping, callback)`
* `Visitor#transaction(id, revenue, shipping, tax)`
* `Visitor#transaction(id, revenue, shipping, tax, callback)`
* `Visitor#transaction(id, revenue, shipping, tax, affiliation)`
* `Visitor#transaction(id, revenue, shipping, tax, affiliation, callback)`
* `Visitor#transaction(params)`
* `Visitor#transaction(params, callback)`

The following method signatures are available for #item:

* `Visitor#item(price)`
* `Visitor#item(price, callback)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, callback)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku, callback)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku, name)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku, name, callback)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku, name, variation)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku, name, variation, callback)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku, name, variation, params)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku, name, variation, params, callback)`
* `Visitor#item(params)`
* `Visitor#item(params, callback)`

## Exception tracking

Exception tracking is a way to keep track of any sort of application errors and bugs with Google Analytics. Using it with this module is a way to capture server-side problems.

```javascript
visitor.exception("StackOverflow Error").send()
```

As an additional information, the exception can be flagged as fatal if the error was exceptionally bad.

```javascript
var fatal = true;
visitor.exception("StackOverflow Error", fatal, function () {
  // Finish handling this error
});
```

The following method signatures are available for #exception:

* `Visitor#exception(description)`
* `Visitor#exception(description, callback)`
* `Visitor#exception(description, fatal)`
* `Visitor#exception(description, fatal, callback)`
* `Visitor#exception(params)`
* `Visitor#exception(params, callback)`

See also: [List of acceptable params](AcceptableParams.md).






## User timing tracking

Tracking user timings is a way to capture time-based information similar to the page load speed data tracked automatically by Google Analytics. All arguments to this tracking method are optional, but a category, a variable and a time value should be provided. The time value should be provided in milliseconds.

```javascript
visitor.timing("User interaction", "Time to open login overlay", 12547).send()
```

The following method signatures are available for #timing:

* `Visitor#timing(category)`
* `Visitor#timing(category, callback)`
* `Visitor#timing(category, variable)`
* `Visitor#timing(category, variable, callback)`
* `Visitor#timing(category, variable, time)`
* `Visitor#timing(category, variable, time, callback)`
* `Visitor#timing(category, variable, time, label)`
* `Visitor#timing(category, variable, time, label, callback)`
* `Visitor#timing(params)`
* `Visitor#timing(params, callback)`

See also: [List of acceptable params](AcceptableParams.md).





## Transaction tracking

Transactions are the main tracking calls for ecommerce tracking

```javascript
visitor.transaction("123456", "449.99").send()
```

The following method signatures are available for #transaction:

* `Visitor#transaction(transactionId)`
* `Visitor#transaction(transactionId, callback)`
* `Visitor#transaction(transactionId, revenue)`
* `Visitor#transaction(transactionId, revenue, callback)`
* `Visitor#transaction(transactionId, revenue, shippingCost)`
* `Visitor#transaction(transactionId, revenue, shippingCost, callback)`
* `Visitor#transaction(transactionId, revenue, shippingCost, tax)`
* `Visitor#transaction(transactionId, revenue, shippingCost, tax, callback)`
* `Visitor#transaction(transactionId, revenue, shippingCost, tax, affiliation)`
* `Visitor#transaction(transactionId, revenue, shippingCost, tax, affiliation, callback)`
* `Visitor#transaction(transactionId, revenue, shippingCost, tax, affiliation, params)`
* `Visitor#transaction(transactionId, revenue, shippingCost, tax, affiliation, params, callback)`
* `Visitor#transaction(params)`
* `Visitor#transaction(params, callback)`

See also: [List of acceptable params](AcceptableParams.md).





### Transaction item tracking

Transaction consist of one or more items.

```javascript
visitor.item(449.99, 1, "ID54321", "T-Shirt", {ti: "123456"}).send()
```

The following method signatures are available for #item:

* `Visitor#item(price)`
* `Visitor#item(price, callback)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, callback)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku, callback)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku, name)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku, name, callback)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku, name, variation)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku, name, variation, callback)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku, name, variation, params)`
* `Visitor#item(price, quantity, sku, name, variation, params, callback)`
* `Visitor#item(params)`
* `Visitor#item(params, callback)`

See also: [List of acceptable params](AcceptableParams.md).






# Daisy-chaining tracking calls

We have seen basic daisy-chaining above when calling `send()` right after `pageview()` and `event()`:

```javascript
visitor.pageview("/").send()
```

Every call of a tracking method returns a visitor instance you can re-use:

```javascript
visitor.pageview("/").pageview("/contact").send()
```

Granted, the chance of this example actually happening in practice might be rather low.

However, `universal-analytics` is smart when it comes to daisy-chaining certain calls. In many cases, a `pageview()` call is instantly followed by an `event()` call to track some additional information about the current page. `universal-analytics` makes creating the connection between the two easy:

```javascript
visitor.pageview("/landing-page-1").event("Testing", "Button color", "Blue").send()
```
This is the same as two distinct tracking calls.

```javascript
visitor.pageview("/landing-page-1").send()
visitor.event("Testing", "Button color", "Blue", {p: "/landing-page-1"}).send()
```

Daisy-chaining is context-aware and in this case placing the `event()` call right after the `pageview()` call results in the event being associated with the page path tracking in the `pageview()` call. Even though the attributes (`dp` and `p`)  are different internally.

It also works when using a callback since the `this` inside the callback will be the `universal-analytics` Visitor instance:

```javascript
visitor.pageview("/landing-page-1", function (err) {
  if (!err) {
    this.event("Testing", "Button color", "Blue").send()
  }
});
```

More generally, the daisy-chaining context keeps all parameters from the previous call around. This means in a situation where similar tracking calls are necessary tracking is simplified:

```javascript
visitor
  .event({ec: "Mail Server", ea: "New Team Member Notification sent"})
  .event({ea: "Invitation sent"})
  .send();
```

In this example the event category ("Mail Server") is not repeated in the second tracking call.




# Setting persistent parameters

Some parameters should be in every tracking call, such as a user ID or custom dimensions that never or hardly change. For such situations a `#set(key, value)` method is available

```javascript
  visitor.set("uid", "123456789");
```

The uid parameter will be part of every tracking request of that visitor from now on.

For custom dimensions, you will not pass `dimension#` rather `cd#`:

```javascript
 visitor.set("cd[1-20]", "123456789"); // [1-20] will be the dimension number
```

# Filter application tracking data

Set a persistent parameter for [`Data Source`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#ds) to `app` in order to mark tracking data as `Application`.

```javascript
 visitor.set("ds", "app"); // Allows filtering by the 'Application?' field in GA
```

Then create a new view in Google Analytics of type 'Application'. You will then need to filter the data for that view by creating a new filter that either includes or excludes `Application? Yes` (depending on if you want to show(includes) or hide(excludes) application analytics in a given view).

# Session-based identification

In order to make session-based apps easier to work with, `universal-analytics` also provides a middleware that works in an Expressjs-style fashion. It will try to detect a client ID based on the `_ga` cookie used by the analytics.js client-side tracking. Additionally it will store the detected client ID in the current session to recognize the visitor later.

```javascript
var ua = require("universal-analytics");
var express = require("express");

var app = express()

express.use(ua.middleware("UA-XXXX-Y", {cookieName: '_ga'}));
```

The middleware will attach the `universal analytics` visitor instance to every request (`req.visitor`).

Additionally, the module also exposes a `createFromSession` method to create a visitor instance simply based on a session, which is helpful when working with Socket.io, etc. where the middleware is not used.

```javascript
var visitor = ua.createFromSession(socket.handshake.session);
```

# Debug mode

`universal-analytics` is using the [`debug`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library. It can be instructed to output information during tracking by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable:

```
DEBUG=universal-analytics
```


# Request Options

In order to add additional options to the request a `requestOptions` hash can be provided as part of the constructor options. `unviversal-analytics` uses the [`request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) library. Therefor [any option available for that library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request#requestoptions-callback) can be provided via the `requestOptions`.

```javascript
var visitor = ua('UA-XXXX-XX', {
  requestOptions: {
    proxy: "…"
  }
});
```


# Shortcuts

The tracking methods have shortcuts:

* `Visitor#pv` as an alias for `Visitor#pageview`
* `Visitor#e` as an alias for `Visitor#event`
* `Visitor#t` as an alias for `Visitor#transaction`
* `Visitor#i` as an alias for `Visitor#item`


# Tests

The tests are written with [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) using [should](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js) and [Sinon.JS](https://github.com/cjohansen/Sinon.JS).

Run them by executing the following commands in the `universal-analytics` directory:

```
$ npm install
$ make test
```
